# FireDashboardTemplate

This project was designed to be a starting point for furture project ideas.  It is a very simple dashboard that also has login/register
functionality.

It is tied to Firebase so if anybody else wants to use this project, be aware that you need to use Firebase as your project backend.

You also need to replace the firebase.json and .firebaserc files to point to your own Firebase project.
